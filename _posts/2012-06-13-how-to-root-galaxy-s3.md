##Basic instructions
All downloads contain .img files bootable through Fastboot.

Make sure your device is in Fastboot mode (usually you can get there by
holding VolUp+VolDown+Power when the device is turned off), then run the
included script On OSx, you may have to chmod +x mac.sh before the script does anything.

A special boot image will load, which will install (only) SuperSU,
thenreboot into Android
