## Vim, functions, 750words and all-all-all

I really love writing, mostly on russian. Also my English still not
really good and I plan to improve it.
I heard about 750word program, but I certainly don't want to use another
service for writing, I'm stingy)

## Fast research

I found a nice project on GitHub called 750words [^750words] 

[^750words]: [750words project](https://github.com/zacharydenton/750words)


But I need some improvements:

- Vim status bar should display how many words I need to write
- custom status bar will be displayed if I do a writing

Lets go. First I check a stack overflow and yes, job was already done by
someone[^soexample]:

[^soexample]: [Example on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/114431/fast-word-count-function-in-vim)

```
function! WordCount()
  let s:old_status = v:statusmsg
  let position = getpos(".")
  exe ":silent normal g\"
  let stat = v:statusmsg
  let s:word_count = 0
  if stat != '--No lines in buffer--'
    let s:word_count = str2nr(split(v:statusmsg)[11])
    let v:statusmsg = s:old_status
  end
  call setpos('.', position)
  return s:word_count 
endfunction

:set statusline=wc:%{WordCount()}
```

Now next round - how to apply settings right way. Here is a two
different way - based on extension or based on project

I prefer to use a one rc per project, that is a most powerful way than
fix vimrc in common every time
Adding a vim-localrc to Janus plugins:
mkdir ~/.janus; cd ~/.janus
git clone https://github.com/thinca/vim-localrc


Then adding a .local.vimrc with function and modeling to ~/.750words
directory
Testing a function:
:call WordCount()

Its working! Pull request to Denton was sent.
